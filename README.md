# ChurnShield-A-Machine-Learning-Framework-for-Customer-Retention

- This project analyzes the Telco customer churn dataset to identify the key factors driving customer churn. The main objective is to build a machine learning model that predicts which customers are most likely to churn. Understanding these factors enables the telecommunications company to implement targeted strategies to improve retention and reduce revenue loss. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and evaluation of multiple classification models to determine the most accurate predictor of churn.


## Dataset

- The dataset used in this project is the ChurnShield-A-Machine-Learning-Framework-for-Customer-Retention dataset, which contains information about customer demographics, account details, and services they have signed up for.

##  Methodology

- The project follows these steps:
- Data Loading and Initial Exploration: The dataset is loaded and an initial assessment is performed to understand its structure, data types, and basic statistics.
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The TotalCharges column is converted to a numeric data type, and missing values are handled by filling them with the median of the column.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): A detailed analysis of the data is performed to identify patterns and relationships between different features and customer churn.
- Model Building and Evaluation: Several machine learning models are trained on the data to predict customer churn. The performance of these models is then evaluated to select the best one.
